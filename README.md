# pokefight

Weekly group project in the bootcamp.
Made by a team of 4 devs:Aroj,Clirim,Nadia and Neelima.

Using the famous Pokemon Api,in the homepage you can see every pokemon(30 actually) and if you click on the I icon you will get all the information related to that specific pokemon.Main feature would be the fighting part.You can choose a pokemon and the opponent will be a Computer Pokemon that is selected Randomly.When you click on  the FIGHT button,the damage done is impacted by the Attacking points of the attacker.In the leaderboard page,you can ... guess what? Seeeee the leaders of the fight haha.
Made with love and laughs.
